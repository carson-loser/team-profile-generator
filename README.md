# Team Profile Generator

#### By Carson Loser

#### This application is a command line application that allows the user to answer questions through inquirer and have their inputs displayed in a new file.

# Prerequisites and Dependencies

* The command line should accept the users inputs.

* An HTML file should generate after all questions are answered with the inputs displayed accordingly.

* The email and GitHub username inputs should be interactable when clicked.

* When the command line opens, the user should be prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.

* If the chosen answer is incorrect, a certain amount of time (seconds) should be taken off the timer.

* When all prompts are answered, the user should be presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.

* When/if the user selects the engineer option, they will be prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and then taken back to the previous menu.

* When/if the user selects the intern option, they will be prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and then taken back to the previous menu.

* When/if the user decides to finish building their team, they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
